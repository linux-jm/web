.SH NAME
nbp_name \- NBP name parsing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
nbp_name( name, obj, type, zone )
char *name, **obj, **type, **zone;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nbp_name()
parses user supplied names into their component object, type, and
zone.
.BR obj ,
.BR type ,
and
.B zone
should be passed by reference, and should point to the caller's default
values.
.B nbp_name()
will change the pointers to the parsed-out values.
.B name
is of the form
.IB object : \c
.IB type @ \c
.IR zone ,
where each of
.IR object ,
.BI : type ,
and
.BI @ zone
replace
.BR obj ,
.BR type ,
and
.BR zone,
respectively.
.I type
must be proceeded by
.RB ` : ',
and
.I zone
must be preceded by
.RB ` @ '.
.SH EXAMPLE
The argument of
.BR afpd (8)'s
.B -n
option is parsed with
.BR nbp_name() .
The default value of
.B obj
is the first component of the machine's hostname (as returned by
.BR gethostbyname (3)).
The default value of
.B type
is ``AFPServer'', and of
.B zone
is ``*'', the default zone.  To cause
.B afpd
to register itself in some zone other than the default, one would
invoke it as
.sp
.RS
.nf
afpd -n @some-other-zone
.fi
.RE
.sp
.B obj
and
.B type
would retain their default values.
.SH BUGS
.BR obj ,
.BR type ,
and
.B zone
return pointers into static area which may be over-written on each
call.
