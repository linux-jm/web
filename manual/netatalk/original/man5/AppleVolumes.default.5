.SH NAME
AppleVolumes.default \- Configuration file used by \fBafpd\fR(8)
to determine the shares made available through Appletalk

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.default\fR is the configuration file used
by afpd to determine what portions of the file system will be shared via
Appletalk, as well as their behaviors.

Any line not prefixed with \fB#\fR is interpreted. The configuration lines
are composed like:

.RS
.sp
.I path
.B [
.I chooser name
.B ] [
.I options
.B ]

.sp
.RE
The path name must be a fully qualified path name, or a path name using
either the \fB~\fR shell shorthand or any of the substitution variables,
which are listed below.

The chooser name is the name that appears in the Chooser on Macintoshes
to represent the appropriate share. If there are spaces in the name, it
should be in quotes (i.e. \fB"File Share"\fR). The chooser name may not
exceed 27 characters in length, and cannot contain the \fB:\fR character.

The possible options and their meanings are:

.TP
.B allow:[users/groups]
The allow option allows the users and groups that access a share to
be specified. Users and groups are specified, delimited by commas. Groups
are designated by a \fB@\fR prefix.

\fIExample:\fR \fBallow:user1,user2,@group\fR

.TP
.B casefold:[option]
The casefold option handles how casenames should be mangled. The available
options are:

\fBtolower\fR - Lowercases names in both directions.

\fBtoupper\fR - Uppercases names in both directions.

\fBxlatelower\fR - Client sees lowercase, server sees uppercase.

\fBxlateupper\fR - Client sees uppercase, server sees lowercase.

.TP
.B codepage:[nls file]
The codepage option loads a specific codepage from the nls directory.

.TP
.B dbpath:[path]
Sets the database information to be stored in \fBpath\fR.

.TP
.B deny:[users/groups]
The deny option specifies users and groups who are not allowed access
to the share. It follows the same format as the \fBallow\fR option.

.TP
.B options:[option]
This allows multiple options to be specified in a comma delimited format.
The available options are:

\fBcrlf\fR - Enables crlf translation for TEXT files.

\fBdropbox\fR - Allows a volume to be declared as being a "dropbox." Note
that netatalk must be compiled with dropkludge support for this to
function.

\fBlimitsize\fR - Hack for older Macintoshes using newer Appleshare
clients to limit the disk size reporting to 2 GB.

\fBmswindows\fR - Forces filename restrictions imposed by MS WinXX, and
invokes the MS default codepage (iso8859-1) if one is not already
specified.

\fBnoadouble\fR - Forces afpd to not create .AppleDouble unless a resource
fork needs to be created.

\fBnohex\fR - Disables :hex translations for anything except dot files.
This option makes the \fB/\fR character illegal.

\fBprodos\fR - Provides compatibility with Apple II clients.

\fBro\fR - Specifies the share as being read only for all users.

\fBusedots\fR - Don't do :hex translation for dot files. This makes all
files such as .Parent, .Apple* illegal. Dot files created on the server
side will be invisible to the client.

.TP
.B password:[password]
This option allows you to set a volume password, which can be a maximum
of 8 characters long.

.TP
.B rolist:[users/groups]
Allows certain users and groups to have read-only access to a share.
This follows the \fBallow\fR option format.

.TP
.B rwlist:[users/groups]
Allows certain users and groups to have read/write access to a share.
This follows the \fBallow\fR option format.

.P
The variables which can be used for subsitutions are:

.TP
.B $c
client's ip or appletalk address

.TP
.B $f
full name (contents of the gecos field in the passwd file)

.TP
.B $g
group name

.TP
.B $h
hostname

.TP
.B $s
server name (this can be the hostname)

.TP
.B $u
user name (if guest, it is the user that guest is running as)

.TP
.B $v
volume name (either ADEID_NAME or basename of path)

.TP
.B $z
appletalk zone (may not exist)

.TP
.B $$
prints dollar sign (\fb$\fR)
