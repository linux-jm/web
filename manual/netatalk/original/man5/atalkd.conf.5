.SH NAME
atalkd.conf \- Configuration file used by \fBatalkd\fR(8)
to determine the interfaces used by the master Netatalk daemon

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/netatalk/atalkd.conf\fR is the configuration file used
by atalkd to configure the Appletalk interfaces and their behavior

Any line not prefixed with \fB#\fR is interpreted. The configuration lines
are composed like:

.RS
.sp
.I interface
.B [
.I options
.B ]

.sp
.RE
The simplest case is to have either no atalkd.conf, or to have one that
has no active lines. In this case, atalkd should auto-discover the local
interfaces on the machine. Please note that you cannot split lines.

The interface is the network interface that this to work over, such as
\fBeth0\fR for Linux, or \fBle0\fR for Sun.

The possible options and their meanings are:

.TP
.B -addr net.node
Allows specification of the net and node numbers for this interface,
specified in Appletalk numbering format (example: \fI-addr 66.6\fR).

.TP
.B -dontroute
Disables Appletalk routing. It is the opposite of \fB-router\fR.

.TP
.B -net first[-last]
Allows the available net to be set, optionally as a range.

.TP
.B -phase ( 1 | 2 )
Specifies the Appletalk phase that this interface is to use (either Phase
1 or Phase 2).

.TP
.B -router
Like \fB-seed\fR, but allows single interface routing. It is the opposite
of \fB-dontroute\fR.

.TP
.B -seed
The seed option only works if you have multiple interfaces. It also causes
all missing arguments to be automagically configured from the network.

.TP
.B -zone zonename
Specifies a specific zone that this interface should appear on (example:
\fI-zone "Parking Lot"\fR). Please note that zones with spaces and other
special characters should be enclosed in parentheses.
