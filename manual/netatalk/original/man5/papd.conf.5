.SH NAME
papd.conf \- Configuration file used by \fBpapd\fR(8)
to determine the configuration of printers used by the Netatalk printing
daemon

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/netatalk/papd.conf\fR is the configuration file used
by papd to configure the printing services offered by netatalk. Please note
that papd must be enabled in \fB/etc/netatalk/netatalk.conf\fR for this to take
any effect. \fBpapd\fR shares the same defaults as lpd on many systems, but not
Solaris.

Any line not prefixed with \fB#\fR is interpreted. The configuration lines
are composed like:

.RS
.sp
.I printername:[options]

.sp
.RE
The simplest case is to have either no papd.conf, or to have one that
has no active lines. In this case, atalkd should auto-discover the local
printers on the machine. Please note that you can split lines by using
\fB\\\fR.

printername may be just a name (\fBPrinter 1\fR), or it may be a full name
in nbp_name format (\fBPrinter 1:LaserWriter@My Zone\fR).  If more than 15
printers are defined, you should explicitly define the zone for each printer.
Otherwise, the Mac Chooser not show all the printers.

The possible options are colon delimited (\fB:\fR), and lines must be
terminated with colons. The possible options and flags are:

.TP
.B am=(uams list)
The \fBam\fR option allows specific UAMs to be specified for a particular
printer. It has no effect if the \fBau\fR flag is not present or if papd
authentication was not built into netatalk.

.TP
.B au
If present, this flag enables authentication for the printer. Please note
that papd authentication must be built into netatalk for this to take
effect.

.TP
.B op=(operator)
This specifies the operator name, for lpd spooling.

.TP
.B pa=(appletalk address)
Allows specification of Appletalk addresses. Usually not needed.

.TP
.B pd=(path to ppd file)
Specifies a particular PPD (printer description file) to associate with
the selected printer.

.TP
.B pr=(lpd printer name)
Sets the \fBlpd\fR printer that this is spooled to.
