"The I<make> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large "
"program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  "
"The manual describes the GNU implementation of B<make>, which was written by "
"Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul "
"Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you "
"can use B<make> with any programming language whose compiler can be run with "
"a shell command.  In fact, B<make> is not limited to programs.  You can use "
"it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from "
"others whenever the others change."

"To prepare to use B<make>, you must write a file called the I<makefile> that "
"describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states the "
"commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable "
"file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling "
"source files."
