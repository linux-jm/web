.TH manpath 1 "July 12th, 1995" "2.3.10" "Manual pager utils"
.SH NAME
manpath \- determine search path for manual pages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B manpath  
.RB [\| \-qgdc \|] 
.RB [\| \-m
.IR system \|[\|,.\|.\|.\|]\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If 
.RB $ MANPATH
is set, 
.B manpath
will simply display it's contents and issue a warning.
If not, 
.B manpath 
will determine a suitable manual page hierarchy search path and display the
results.

The colon delimited path is determined using information gained from the
man_db configuration file -
.RI ( "/usr/local/etc/man_db.config" ),
the user's environment and their current working directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Do not issue warnings.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Produce debugging information.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-catpath
Produce a catpath as opposed to a manpath. 
Once the manpath is determined,
each path element is converted to it's relative catpath.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-global
Produce a manpath consisting of all paths named as `global' within the
man_db configuration file. 
.\"
.\" Due to the rather silly limit of 6 args per request in some `native'
.\" *roff compilers, we have do the following to get the two-line
.\" hanging tag on one line. .PP to begin a new paragraph, then the
.\" tag, then .RS (start relative indent), the text, finally .RE
.\" (end relative indent).
.\"
.PP
.B \-m 
.I system\c 
.RB \|[\|,.\|.\|.\|]\| ,
.BI \-\-systems= system\c 
\|[\|,.\|.\|.\|]
.RS
If this system has access to other operating system's manual hierarchies, 
this option can be used to include them in the output of
.BR manpath .
To include NewOS's manual page hierarchies use the option
.B \-m
.BR NewOS .

The
.I system
specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating
system names.
To include the native operating system's manual page hierarchies, 
the system name
.B man
must be included in the argument string.
This option will override the
.RB $ SYSTEM
environment variable.
.RE
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Display version and author information.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B MANPATH
If
.RB $ MANPATH
is set,
.B manpath
displays it's value rather than determining it on the fly.
.TP
.B SYSTEM
If
.RB $ SYSTEM
is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the
argument to the
.B \-m
option.
.SH FILES
.TP \w'/usr/local/etc/man_db.config'u+2n
.I /usr/local/etc/man_db.config
