"The changes in this revision are not as large as those that occurred for "
"POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new interfaces are added and various "
"details of existing specifications are modified.  Many of the interfaces "
"that were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision of "
"the standard.  A few interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked "
"as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether."
