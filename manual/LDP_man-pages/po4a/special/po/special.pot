#.  Always including the PID in the name of the core file made
#.  sense for LinuxThreads, where each thread had a unique PID,
#.  but doesn't seem to serve any purpose with NPTL, where all the
#.  threads in a process share the same PID (as POSIX.1 requires).
#.  Probably the behavior is maintained so that applications using
#.  LinuxThreads continue appending the PID (the kernel has no easy
#.  way of telling which threading implementation the user-space
#.  application is using). -- mtk, April 2006
