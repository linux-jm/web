"I<Screen> is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical "
"terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells).  Each "
"virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in "
"addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) "
"and ISO 2022 standards (e.\\|g. insert/delete line and support for multiple "
"character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual "
"terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions "
"between windows."

msgid ""
"When I<screen> is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or "
"the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the "
"program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can create new "
"(full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells), "
"kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn output logging on and "
"off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view the scrollback history, "
"switch between windows in whatever manner you wish, etc. All windows run "
"their programs completely independent of each other. Programs continue to "
"run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole "
"I<screen> session is detached from the user's terminal.  When a program "
"terminates, I<screen> (per default) kills the window that contained it.  If "
"this window was in the foreground, the display switches to the previous "
"window; if none are left, I<screen> exits."

"Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current window.  "
"The only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initiate a "
"command to the window manager.  By default, each command begins with a "
"control-a (abbreviated C-a from now on), and is followed by one other "
"keystroke.  The command character and all the key bindings can be fully "
"customized to be anything you like, though they are always two characters in "
"length."

"by first binding the command to a keystroke (in your .screenrc file or at "
"the \\*QC-a :\\*U command line) and then using it just like the \\*QC-a "
"c\\*U command.  In addition, new windows can be created by running a command "

"margins (automatic margins plus usable last column). This is the VT100 style "

"\\*Qtrue\\*U auto-margin terminal I<screen> will be content to use it, but "
"updating a character put into the last position on the screen may not be "

"Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how I<screen> deals "

"When flow-control is turned off, I<screen> ignores the XON and XOFF "
"characters, which allows the user to send them to the current program by "

"program to pause in response to an XOFF.  With flow-control turned on, XON "
"and XOFF characters are used to immediately pause the output of the current "
"window.  You can still send these characters to the current program, but you "
"must use the appropriate two-character I<screen> commands (typically \\*QC-a "
"q\\*U (xon)  and \\*QC-a s\\*U (xoff)).  The xon/xoff commands are also "
"useful for typing C-s and C-q past a terminal that intercepts these "

"that I<screen> has accumulated from the interrupted program to be flushed.  "
"One disadvantage is that the virtual terminal's memory contains the "
