"The sorting phase of compression gathers together similar strings in the "
"file.  Because of this, files containing very long runs of repeated symbols, "
"like \"aabaabaabaab ...\" (repeated several hundred times) may compress more "
"slowly than normal.  Versions 0.9.5 and above fare much better than previous "
"versions in this respect.  The ratio between worst-case and average-case "
"compression time is in the region of 10:1.  For previous versions, this "
"figure was more like 100:1.  You can use the -vvvv option to monitor "
"progress in great detail, if you want."

"I<bzip2> usually allocates several megabytes of memory to operate in, and "

"performance, both for compressing and decompressing, is largely determined "

"this, small changes to the code to reduce the miss rate have been observed "
"to give disproportionately large performance improvements.  I imagine "

"me to improve the worst-case compression performance.  Donna Robinson "
"XMLised the documentation.  The bz* scripts are derived from those of GNU "
"gzip.  Many people sent patches, helped with portability problems, lent "
