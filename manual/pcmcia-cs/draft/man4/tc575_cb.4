.\"O .SH NAME
.\"O 3c575_cb \- 3Com 3c575 Etherlink XL 10/100 CardBus device driver
.\"O .SH SYNOPSIS
.\"O .B insmod 3c575_cb.o
.\"O .RB [ pc_debug=\c
.\"O .IR n ]
.\"O .SH DESCRIPTION
.\"O .B 3c575_cb
.\"O is the low-level Card Services driver for the 3Com 3c575 EtherLink XL
.\"O CardBus ethernet adapter.  When this driver is attached to a card, it
.\"O allocates the next available ethernet device
.\"O .RB ( eth0 .. eth# ).
.\"O This information for this card will be reported in the kernel log file, and
.\"O the device name passed on to
.\"O .BR cardmgr (8).
.\"O .PP
.\"O The driver uses the N-Way autonegotiating transceiver to negotiate the speed
.\"O and duplex of the network link.  If the link partner does not support
.\"O negotiation only the link speed is detected.
.\"O .PP
.\"O If the on-card EEPROM is programmed for a full-duplex (FD) link, only FD media
.\"O types are advertised and the link is assumed to be full-duplex.
.\"O .SH PARAMETERS
.\"O .TP
.\"O .BI rx_copybreak= n
.\"O Set the breakpoint for copying incoming frames into reduced-sized
.\"O packet buffers.  The default value of 200 bytes is reasonable for most systems.
.\"O .TP
.\"O .BI max_interrupt_work= n
.\"O This option selects the maximum amount of work handled during each
.\"O interrupt.  Each received packet counts as one unit of work, as does
.\"O updating statistics counters and handling errors.  The default value of
.\"O 20 should only need to be increased on very slow machines.
.\"O If "too much work at interrupt" messages are logged
.\"O the system power management configuration should be set to full speed rather
.\"O than increasing this value.
