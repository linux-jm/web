.\"O .SH DESCRIPTION
.\"O .B Smc91c92_cs
.\"O is the low-level Card Services driver for SMC 91c92, 91c94,
.\"O 91c96, and 91c100 based PC Card ethernet adapters.  When this
.\"O driver is attached to a card, it
.\"O allocates the next available ethernet device
.\"O .RB ( eth0 .. eth# ).
.\"O This
.\"O device name will be reported in the kernel log file, and passed on to
.\"O .BR cardmgr (8).
.\"O .PP
.\"O With the default transceiver setting, the driver will attempt to
.\"O continuously autodetect the transceiver type (10base2 or 10baseT).
.\"O There should normally only be a one or two second lag before the
.\"O correct transceiver is selected.  On particularly noisy or busy
.\"O networks, it is possible for the detection logic to incorrectly
.\"O toggle the transceiver type.  If this becomes a problem, it may be
.\"O necessary to explicitly select the interface type when the module is
.\"O loaded or with the 
.\"O .B ifport
.\"O command.
.\"O 
.\"O .SH PARAMETERS
.\"O .TP
.\"O .BI pc_debug= n
.\"O Selects the PCMCIA debugging level.  This parameter is only available
.\"O if the module is compiled with debugging enabled.  A non-zero value
.\"O enables debugging.
.\"O .TP
.\"O .BI if_port= n
.\"O Selects the transceiver type.  0 is autodetect (10baseT or 10base2),
.\"O 1 is 10baseT (twisted pair), and 2 is 10base2 (BNC, or thin net).  The
.\"O default is 0 (autodetect).
.\"O .TP
.\"O .BI irq_list= i,j,...
.\"O Specifies the set of interrupts that may be allocated by this driver.
.\"O .SH DIAGNOSTICS
.\"O .TP
.\"O .B eth#: interrupt(s) dropped!
.\"O Indicates that the driver did not receive an interrupt notification
.\"O for some reason.  The driver will poll the card (with a significant
.\"O performance penalty) if the problem persists.  The most likely cause
.\"O is an interrupt conflict and/or host bridge configuration problem.
