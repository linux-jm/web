.\" DESCRIPTION part
.\"
.\"O .SH DESCRIPTION
.\"O .I wvlan_cs
.\"O is the low-level Card Services driver for the Lucent
.\"O .B WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11
.\"O and compatible (the NCR
.\"O .B WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11
.\"O , the Cabletron
.\"O .B RoamAbout 802.11 DS
.\"O , the Melco
.\"O .B WLI-PCM-L11
.\"O ) wireless ethernet adapters.  When this driver is attached to a card, it
.\"O allocates the next available device (wvlan0..wvlan#).  This
.\"O device name will be passed on to
.\"O .IR cardmgr (8)
.\"O for the card configuration, and reported in the kernel log.

.\" WIRELESS part
.\"
.\"O .SH WIRELESS EXTENSIONS
.\"O Use
.\"O .IR iwconfig (8)
.\"O to manipulate wireless extensions. 
.\"O You need a kernel which was compiled with CONFIG_NET_RADIO set.
.\"O It is recommended that you run at least Linux kernel 2.2.11 and use wireless_tools 19.
.\"O Older version do not support all of the current commands.
.\"	ESSID sub part
.\"O .SS ESSID (network ID)
.\"O Set the network ID of the desired network to connect to (with access point)
.\"O or the name of your private ad-hoc network (no access point).
.\"	mode sub part
.\"O .SS Mode
.\"O Set the operating mode to
.\"O .I Ad-Hoc
.\"O or
.\"O .IR Managed .
.\"O In managed mode, the card will try to connect to an Access Point, to
.\"O get access to the infrastructure. In Ad-Hoc mode, the card doesn't
.\"O require an Access Point and can communicate directly with its peers.
.\"	Frequency sub part
.\"O .SS Frequency & channels
.\"O Channel (frequency) for ad-hoc networks. The frequency is changed
.\"O immediately and is only changeable in ad-hoc network mode. You may
.\"O enter a frequency value in the 2.4 GHz band or the channel number.
.\"O .br
.\"O Valid values:
.\"O .I 2.412, 2.417, 2.422, 2.427, 2.432, 2.437, 2.442, 2.447, 2.452, 2.457, 2.462,
.\"O .I 2.467, 2.472

.\"O .RI [ 2 ]
.\"O medium density,
.\"O .RI [ 3 ]
.\"O high density.
.\"	Rts sub part
.\"O .SS Rts
.\"O Sets the medium reservation threshold (RTS/CTS frame length), which
.\"O affects the number of octets in a message or fragment above which a
.\"O RTS/CTS handshake is performed.
.\"O .br
.\"O Use
.\"O .RI [ 500 ]
.\"O when there are hidden stations or large number of nodes and
.\"O .RI [ 2347 ]
.\"O for no RTS/CTS (default). Valid range:
.\"O .RI [ 0 - 2347]
.\"	Frag sub part
.\"O .SS Frag
.\"O Defines the number of bytes used for the fragmentation boundary for
.\"O directed messages (Fragmentation length unicast message
.\"O transmission). To be use when you have interferences on the radio,
.\"O because it decreases significantely the performance.
.\"O .br
.\"O .RI [ 2346 ]
.\"O is the default, valid range:
.\"O .RI [ 256 - 2346 ].
.\"	Rate sub part
.\"O .SS Rate
.\"O Set the rate used for transmission (but not reception). You may want
.\"O to set it to a fixed value for high number of nodes.
.\"O .br
.\"O The default is
.\"O .IR auto ,
.\"O or you may use
.\"O .IR 1 ", " 2  ", " 5.5 " or " 11
.\"O Mb/s (of course, 2 Mb/s cards can get the higher speeds).
.\"	Enc sub part
.\"O .SS Enc
.\"O Set the encryption key
.\"O .RI [ 0
.\"O to
.\"O .IR FFFF-FFFF-FF ].
.\"O Use
.\"O .RI [ off ]
.\"O and
.\"O .RI [ on ]
.\"O to disable and reenable the hardware encryption. This feature works
.\"O only for device with encryption option (Silver or Gold).
.\"O .br
.\"O The card has 4 different keys that you may select, and you can choose
.\"O the default key for transmission (see
.\"O .IR iwconfig (8)).
.\"	Nick sub part
.\"O .SS Nick (station name)
.\"O Set the station name (only used for debugging purpose).
.\"	Spy sub part
.\"O .SS Statistics spy
.\"O Set a list of MAC addresses in the driver (up to 8) and get the last
.\"O quality of link for each of those (see
.\"O .IR iwspy (8)).
.\"	/proc/net/wireless part
.\"O .SS /proc/net/wireless
.\"O .I status
.\"O is the status reported by the modem.
.\"O .I Level
.\"O and
.\"O .I Noise
.\"O refer to the signal level and noise level in dBm.
.\"
.\" IOCTL part
.\"
.\"O .SH PRIVATE IOCTL
.\"O You may use
.\"O .IR iwpriv (8)
.\"O to manipulate private ioctls.
.\"	Histogram part
.\"O .SS Histogram
.\"O This functionality allow to set a number of signal level intervals and
.\"O to count the number of packets received in each of those defined
.\"O intervals. This distribution might be used to calculate the mean value
.\"O and standard deviation of the signal level.
.\"
.\" SPECIFIC part
.\"
.\"O .SH SPECIFIC NOTES
.\"O Some of the mentioned features are optional. You may enable to disable
.\"O them by changing flags in the driver header and recompile.
.\"O .PP
.\"O It's currently not possible to use the WaveLAN/IEEE as a bridge (MAC
.\"O level). This is not a restriction of the driver, the NIC firmware
.\"O doesn't allow to send out packets with another source MAC address
.\"O than its own (which is mandatory required for bridgeing to work).
.\"O .PP
.\"O Also the WaveLAN/IEEE can be used to connect to an Access Point, but
.\"O cannot be an Access Point itself (because lack of bridgeing).
