"The input parser was the first attempt B<ever> at natural-language parsing "
"in a game and has some known deficiencies\\&. While later text adventures "
"distinguished between transitive and intransitive verbs, Adventure\\(cqs "
"grammar distinguishes only between motion and action verbs\\&. Motions are "
"always immediate in their behavior, so both ACTION MOTION and MOTION ACTION "
"(and even MOTION NOUN and MOTION MOTION) are invariably equivalent to MOTION "
"(thus GO NORTH means NORTH and JUMP DOWN means JUMP)\\&. Whereas, with "
"actions and nouns, the parser collects words until it\\(cqs seen one of "
"each, and then dispatches; if it reaches the end of the command without "
"seeing a noun, it\\(cqll dispatch an \"intransitive\" action\\&. This makes "
"ACTION1 ACTION2 equivalent to ACTION2 (thus TAKE INVENTORY means INVENTORY), "
"and NOUN ACTION equivalent to ACTION NOUN\\&."
