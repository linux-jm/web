"I<cups-driverd> shows or lists PPD files. It is run in response to CUPS-Add-"
"Modify-Printer or CUPS-Get-Devices requests.  The first form (\"cups-driverd "
"cat ppd-name\") writes the named PPD file to stdout. The output format is an "
"uncompressed PPD file."

"The second form lists the available manufacturers or PPD files to stdout as "
"indicated by the I<options> argument. The output format is an IPP response "
"message. The I<request_id> argument is the request ID from the original IPP "
"request, typically 1. The I<limit> argument is the limit value from the "
"original IPP request - 0 means no limit. Finally, the I<options> argument is "
"a space-delimited list of attributes (\"name=value name=value \\&...\") that "
"were passed in with the request. Currently I<cups-driverd> looks for the "
"I<ppd-make> and I<requested-attributes> attributes and tailors the output "
