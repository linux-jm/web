"I<cups-deviced> polls the backends in I</usr/lib/cups/backend> for a list of "
"available devices.  It is run by I<cupsd(8)> in response to a I<CUPS-Get-"
"Devices> request. The output format is an IPP response message. The "
"I<request-id> argument is the request ID from the original IPP request, "
"typically 1. The I<limit> argument is the limit value from the original IPP "
"request - 0 means no limit. The I<user-id> argument is the requesting-user-"
"name value from the original IPP request.  Finally, the I<options> argument "
"is a space-delimited list of attributes (\"name=value name=value ...\") that "
"were passed in with the request. Currently I<cups-deviced> looks for the "
"I<requested-attributes> attribute and tailors the output accordingly."
