"I<cups-lpd> is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon (\"LPD\")  mini-server that "
"supports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol. I<cups-lpd> does "
"not act as a standalone network daemon but instead operates using the "
"Internet \"super-server\" I<inetd(8)> or I<xinetd(8)>. If you are using "
"I<inetd>, add the following line to the I<inetd.conf> file to enable the "
"I<cups-lpd> mini-server:"
