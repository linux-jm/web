"Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.  It can "
"copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a "
"remote rsync daemon.  It offers a large number of options that control every "
"aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible specification of the set of "
"files to be copied.  It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which "
"reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the "
"differences between the source files and the existing files in the "
"destination.  Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an "
"improved copy command for everyday use."

"Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a \"\\&quick check\"\\& "

"quick check indicates that the file\\(cq\\&s data does not need to be "
