msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The B<ipq_read> function reads a queue message from the kernel and copies it to the memory pointed to by I<buf> to a maximum length of I<len>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The I<h> parameter is a context handle which must previously have been returned successfully from a call to B<ipq_create_handle>."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The caller is responsible for ensuring that the memory pointed to by I<buf> is large enough to contain I<len> bytes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The I<timeout> parameter may be used to set a timeout for the operation, specified in microseconds.  This is implemented internally by the library via the B<select> system call.  A value of zero provides normal, backwards-compatible blocking behaviour with no timeout.  A negative value causes the function to return immediately."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "Data returned via I<buf> should not be accessed directly.  Use the B<ipq_message_type>, B<ipq_get_packet>, and B<ipq_get_msgerr> functions to access the queue message in the buffer."

#. type: SH
#, no-wrap
msgid "RETURN VALUE"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "On failure, -1 is returned."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "On success, a non-zero positive value is returned when no timeout value is specified."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "On success with a timeout value specified, zero is returned if no data was available to read, or if a non-blocked signal was caught.  In the latter case, the global B<errno> value will be set to B<EINTR>."

msgid "DIAGNOSTICS"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "While the B<ipq_read> function may return successfully, the queue message copied to the buffer may itself be an error message from a higher level kernel component.  Use B<ipq_message_type> to determine if it is an error message, and B<ipq_get_msgerr> to access the value of the message."
