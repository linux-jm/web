msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "B<arptables> is a user space tool, it is used to set up and maintain the tables of ARP rules in the Linux kernel. These rules inspect the ARP frames which they see.  B<arptables> is analogous to the B<iptables> user space tool, but B<arptables> is less complicated."

#. type: SS
#, no-wrap
msgid "CHAINS"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "The kernel table is used to divide functionality into different sets of rules. Each set of rules is called a chain.  Each chain is an ordered list of rules that can match ARP frames. If a rule matches an ARP frame, then a processing specification tells what to do with that matching frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'. However, if the frame does not match the current rule in the chain, then the next rule in the chain is examined and so forth.  The user can create new (user-defined) chains which can be used as the 'target' of a rule."

msgid "TARGETS"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "A firewall rule specifies criteria for an ARP frame and a frame processing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a rule, then the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the target.  The target can be one of these values: I<ACCEPT>, I<DROP>, I<CONTINUE>, I<RETURN>, an 'extension' (see below) or a user-defined chain."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "I<ACCEPT> means to let the frame through.  I<DROP> means the frame has to be dropped.  I<CONTINUE> means the next rule has to be checked. This can be handy to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain or to log those frames.  I<RETURN> means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For the extension targets please see the B<TARGET EXTENSIONS> section of this man page."
