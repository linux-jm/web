msgid "This example shows event monitoring.  Line one shows creation of a table (filter in this case), followed by three base hooks INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT.  The iptables-nftables tools all create tables and base chains automatically when needed, so this is expected when a table was not yet initialized or when it is re-created from scratch by iptables-nftables-restore.  Line five shows a new user-defined chain (TCP)  being added, followed by addition a few rules. the last line shows that a new ruleset generation has become active, i.e., the rule set changes are now active.  This also lists the process id and the programs name."
