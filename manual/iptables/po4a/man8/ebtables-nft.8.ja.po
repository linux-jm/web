msgid "DESCRIPTION"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "B<ebtables> is an application program used to set up and maintain the tables of rules (inside the Linux kernel) that inspect Ethernet frames.  It is analogous to the B<iptables> application, but less complicated, due to the fact that the Ethernet protocol is much simpler than the IP protocol."
msgstr ""

#. type: SS
#, no-wrap
msgid "CHAINS"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "There are two ebtables tables with built-in chains in the Linux kernel. These tables are used to divide functionality into different sets of rules. Each set of rules is called a chain.  Each chain is an ordered list of rules that can match Ethernet frames. If a rule matches an Ethernet frame, then a processing specification tells what to do with that matching frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'. However, if the frame does not match the current rule in the chain, then the next rule in the chain is examined and so forth.  The user can create new (user-defined) chains that can be used as the 'target' of a rule. User-defined chains are very useful to get better performance over the linear traversal of the rules and are also essential for structuring the filtering rules into well-organized and maintainable sets of rules."

#. type: Plain text
msgid "A firewall rule specifies criteria for an Ethernet frame and a frame processing specification called a target.  When a frame matches a rule, then the next action performed by the kernel is specified by the target.  The target can be one of these values: B<ACCEPT>, B<DROP>, B<CONTINUE>, B<RETURN>, an 'extension' (see below) or a jump to a user-defined chain."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "B<ACCEPT> means to let the frame through.  B<DROP> means the frame has to be dropped.  B<CONTINUE> means the next rule has to be checked. This can be handy, f.e., to know how many frames pass a certain point in the chain, to log those frames or to apply multiple targets on a frame.  B<RETURN> means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For the extension targets please refer to the B<TARGET EXTENSIONS> section of this man page."

msgid "TABLES"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "As stated earlier, there are two ebtables tables in the Linux kernel.  The table names are B<filter> and B<nat>.  Of these two tables, the filter table is the default table that the command operates on.  If you are working with the filter table, then you can drop the '-t filter' argument to the ebtables command.  However, you will need to provide the -t argument for B<nat> table.  Moreover, the -t argument must be the first argument on the ebtables command line, if used."

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid "B<nat> is mostly used to change the mac addresses and contains three built-in chains: B<PREROUTING> (for altering frames as soon as they come in), B<OUTPUT> (for altering locally generated or (b)routed frames before they are bridged) and B<POSTROUTING> (for altering frames as they are about to go out). A small note on the naming of chains PREROUTING and POSTROUTING: it would be more accurate to call them PREFORWARDING and POSTFORWARDING, but for all those who come from the iptables world to ebtables it is easier to have the same names.
