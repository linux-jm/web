.TH true 1 "18 June 2002" "GNU Shell Utilities 2.1"
.SH NAME
true \- do nothing, successfully
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B true [\-\-help] [\-\-version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B true
does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning ``success''.

Implemented as a binary, it can be used as a place holder in shell scripts
where a successful command is needed (although the shell built-in command
`\fB:\fR' may be faster)

\fBtrue\fR ignores \fB\-\-help\fR and \fB\-\-version\fR if the
POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-\-version"
Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.
.SH NOTES
Report bugs to bug-sh-utils@gnu.org.
