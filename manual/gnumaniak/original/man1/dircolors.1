.TH DIRCOLORS 1 "18 June 2002" "GNU fileutils 4.1"
.SH NAME
dircolors \- color setup for `ls'
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dircolors
.B [\-b] [\-\-sh] [\-\-bourne\-shell]
.B [\-c] [\-\-csh] [\-\-c\-shell]
.B [\-p] [\-\-print\-database]
.B [\-\-help] [\-\-version]
.BI [ FILE ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dircolors
outputs a sequence of shell commands to define the desired
color output from
.B ls
(and
.BR dir ,
etc.).  Typical usage:
.br
.RS
eval `dircolors [OPTION]... [FILE]`
.RE
.PP
If
.I FILE
is specified,
.B dircolors
reads it to determine which colors to use for which file types and
extensions.  Otherwise, a precompiled database is used.  For details
on the format of these files, run `dircolors --print-database'.
.PP
The output is a shell command to set the
.B LS_COLORS
environment variable.  You can specify the shell syntax to use on the
command line, or
.B dircolors
will guess it from the value of the
.B SHELL
environment variable.
.PP
After execution of this command, `ls --color' (which one might alias to ls)
will list files in the desired colors.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
