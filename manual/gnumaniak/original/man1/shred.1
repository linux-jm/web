.TH SHRED 1 "18 June 2002" "GNU fileutils 4.1"
.SH NAME
\fBshred\fR \- overwrite files repeatedly
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "shred " [ \-\fIITERS\fB "]  [" \-fuvxz "] [" "\-n \fIITERS\fB "] [" "\-s \fISIZE\fR "] "
.RB [ \-\-force "] [" \-\-iterations=\fIITER\fB "] [" \-\-size=\fISIZE\fB "] "
.RB [ \-\-remove "] [" \-\-verbose "] [" \-\-exact "] [" \-\-zero "] "
.I FILE\fR[\fB...\fR]

.BR shred " [" \-\-help "] [" \-\-version ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shred
writes repeatedly on the specified \fIFILE\fRs with special patterns in
order to make it more difficult to recover the data .  If
.I FILE
is a
.RB ` \- ',
standard input is used as input for that file.

Note that \fBshred\fR operates on the assumption that write operations to
a file will happen in the same place, and it might not be so (as in
transactional, distributed or remote filesystems).  Also, when employed on
devices (/dev/hda), RAID will affect operations in a similar way.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-force"
Ignore permissions when writing if possible.
.TP
.B "\-\fIITERS\fB, \-n \fIITERS\fB, \-\-iterations=\fIITERS\fB"
Overwrite \fIITERS\fB times. (Default: 25)
.TP
.B "\-s \fISIZE\fR, \-\-size=\fISIZE\fR"
Shred only \fISIZE\fR bytes.  Size may use multiplier letters (See below)
.TP
.B "\-u, \-\-remove"
Truncate and unlink file after \fBshred\fR is done.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Show progress messages.
.TP
.B "\-x, \-\-exact"
Don't round file sizes up to the full block.
.TP
.B "\-z, \-\-zero"
Overwrite with NULs after \fBshred\fR is done.
.TP
.B "\-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-\-version"
Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.
.SH MULTIPLIERS
Size numbers may be followed by a size letter to specify a multiple of that
size, and a \fBB\fR to select normal bytes or a \fBD\fR to select
decimal "commercial" bytes.  For example `1KB' is equal to `1024' and
`1KD' is equal to `1000'.  Exceptions are \fBb\fR (512 bytes), \fBc\fR (1
byte), and \fBw\fR (which should never be used - it means 2 in System V and
4 in 4.2BSD), which can't be followed by a \fBB\fR or \fBD\fR.
