.SH NAME
\fBsha1sum\fR \- calculate and check SHA1 hash checksums
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sha1sum
.RB [ \-bctw ]
.RB [ \-\-binary ]
.RB [ \-\-check ]
.RB [ \-\-status ]
.RB [ \-\-text ]
.RB [ \-\-warn ]
.RI [ FILE... ]

.BR sha1sum " [" \-\-help "] [" \-\-version ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sha1sum
outputs or checks the SHA1 checkum of
.I FILE s according to FIPS-180-1.  If
.I FILE
is omitted or if is a
.RB ` \- ',
standard input is used.   

Output format when calculating checksums consists for each input \fIFILE\fR,
in a SHA1 sum, a space, a file type character (`*' for binary, ` ' for text)
and a filename.  This is the format \fB\-\-check\fR expects.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-binary
Reads the input \fIFILE\fRs in binary mode. This option has no effect on Unix
systems, since they don't distinguish between binary and text files.  This is
the default on DOS platforms. 
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-check
Reads filenames and checksums from the given \fIFILE\fRs, and report wether
each file and the corresponding checksum are correct.  \fb\-\-check\fR
expects the same format \fBsha1sum\fR outputs.
.sp
.nf
For example:
sha1sum *.sha1 > checksums.sha1
sha1sum \-\-check checksums.sha1
.fi
.TP
.B \-\t, \-\-text
Reads the input \fIFILE\fRs in text mode.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-warn
Warn about badly formatted entries.  Only makes sense with \fB\-\-check\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-status
Silently exit with a status return code.  Warnings or checksum failures are
omitted, and errors from operations such as opening are reading are printed.
A successful exit code of 0 is only returned is everything is passed and no
errors have ocurred.  Otherwise a non-zero value is returned.
.TP
.B "\-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-\-version"
Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.
.SH NOTES
Report bugs to bug-textutils@gnu.org.
