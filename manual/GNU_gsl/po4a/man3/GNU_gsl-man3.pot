"The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for numerical "
"computing.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL team in C, and "
"present a modern Applications Programming Interface (API) for C programmers, "
"allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages."
